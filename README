Net::SFTP::Foreign
===================

Net::SFTP::Foreign implements an SFTP client in Perl.

It's a forked version of Net::SFTP that uses an external ssh client to
connect to the ssh server instead of the all Perl Net::SSH::Perl
module.


PREREQUISITES

An external ssh2 client reachable from your PATH.

Perl modules:

	Test::More (mandatory)
	File::Which (optional, only for testing)
	Sort::Key (optional, for better performance)

If the sftp-server command is available it will be used to perform
some tests, but it is not mandatory.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
